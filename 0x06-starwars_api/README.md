# 0x06-starwars_api

## Description
This project is about using an API to get information about Star Wars characters.
The main goal is to learn how to use APIs and how to work with them.

## Challenge
The challenge is to create a script that takes a string as a parameter and searches for all characters that match the string in the Star Wars API.
The script must use the [Star Wars API](https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com/).

## Solution
The solution is a JavaScript script that uses the request module to make a GET request to the Star Wars API.
The script takes a string as a parameter and searches for all characters that match the string in the Star Wars API.
The script prints the name of the characters that match the string.

## Usage
To run the script, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
You can run the script with the following command:
```
$ ./0-starwars_characters.js <movie ID>
```
Where `<movie ID>` is the ID of the movie you want to search for characters in.
